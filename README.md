# copilot-lab-music-store-typescript-complete

## Overview

This repository contains a music store application built with TypeScript. The application consists of two main parts:

1. **API**: A RESTful API built with Express.js that provides endpoints for managing music store data, such as genres, albums, and users.
2. **Web**: A web application built with Next.js that allows users to browse and interact with the music store.

## Getting Started

### API

To get started with the API part of the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the `api` directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**: Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The API server will be running at [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200).

3. **API Documentation**: The API documentation is available at [http://localhost:3200/api-docs](http://localhost:3200/api-docs).

### Web

To get started with the web part of the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the `web` directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**: Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The web application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Open the application**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

4. **Edit the application**: You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

5. **API routes**: API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

6. **Learn more**: To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
   - [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
   - [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

7. **Deploy on Vercel**: The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
